# Human Resources Data Analysis

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook provides a detailed analysis of Human Resources (HR) data, aiming to uncover insights related to employee performance, turnover, and other key metrics. By applying various data analysis techniques and visualisations, the project helps HR departments make data-driven decisions for better workforce management.

## Features
- **Employee Performance Analysis**: Visualise employee performance metrics and identify high and low performers based on various factors.
- **Turnover Analysis**: Explore employee retention trends, identifying patterns in employee turnover across different departments, age groups, or years of service.
- **Department Insights**: Filter data by department to get a deeper understanding of departmental performance and employee satisfaction.
- **Visualisation of Key Metrics**: Interactive charts and graphs that compare metrics such as salary, age, and performance ratings across the workforce.
- **Predictive Modelling**: Basic machine learning models used to predict turnover and other HR-related trends.

## Tools Used
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For creating visualisations of key metrics and trends.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing predictive modelling algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and visualisation.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project includes employee details such as performance ratings, department, tenure, salary, and turnover. The data is anonymised to ensure privacy and complies with data protection standards.

## Key Insights
- **Employee Retention Trends**: Visualisations reveal turnover rates in different departments and among various age groups.
- **Departmental Performance**: Identifying which departments have the highest and lowest performance ratings, and correlating them with factors such as salary, tenure, and department size.
- **Predictive Modelling**: Simple machine learning models can be trained to predict which employees are at risk of leaving, based on historical data.
- **Salary and Performance Correlations**: Discover how employee performance is related to their compensation and other demographics.

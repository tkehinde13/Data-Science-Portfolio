# Credit Card Approval Analysis

## Overview
This project analyses credit card approval data to identify key factors influencing approval decisions. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building to predict approval outcomes.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalising numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualising trends and correlations in the dataset.
- **Model Training**: Implementing machine learning models to predict credit card approvals.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identifying the most significant factors influencing approval decisions.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language for analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualisation.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning model development.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding environment.

## Key Insights
- Identifying attributes with the highest correlation to approval decisions.
- Comparing model performance to determine the best predictive approach.
- Providing recommendations for improving approval rates based on data-driven insights.

## Dataset
- The dataset includes various customer attributes such as age, income, credit score, and employment status.
- Data has been preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical encoding.

## Future Improvements
- Enhancing model accuracy with hyperparameter tuning.
- Incorporating additional external data sources for improved predictions.
- Deploying the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
